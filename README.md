adfl_drupal_profile
===================

This is a working repo for holding code for my adfl drupal profile. This profile holds common features that I install on almost every website.

This install profile will create a number of content types, views, permissions, configuration - all the things that take a day to do usually.

It creates a bean type for sliders and a context to place this slider on the frontpage only. To use, just start adding blocks of type "Rotating Slider" - the rest will look after itself.

It also creates a zen subtheme and sets it as default.

To use, you will need to place the ckeditor, flexslider, and colorbox libraries in the libraries folder.
